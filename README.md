# Supermarket System

## Overview

This project aims to build an entire supermarket-like system for a portfolio from scratch, starting with relational data modeling, SQL DDL creation, and SQL data loading. The exposition will be achieved via a REST API endpoint to interact with both a web app and a desktop app.

## Technologies Used

- Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler
- SQL
- SQLite
- C# with .NET
- Frameworks or libraries

## Data

The core of a system is how data is stored. Data is information, and we store it because we plan to use it, so different usages require different approaches. Data modeling paradigms define different ways of organizing data. The organization affects flexibility, query performance, data integrity, and scalability. Many people start working with data before learning the heart of it, which is data modeling. Data modeling puts your brain to work and makes you think about possibilities and interactions with and between data. Understanding data modeling helps with query logic and all subsequent data manipulation. For this work, I am using relational data modeling via the extended ER model.
